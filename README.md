#Arduino Blinking Array

The purpose of this project is to create an array of blinking LED's which do so in order
##Setup

* Make an array in the IDE of the pins needed
* Create a for loop to initialize all pins as outputs
* create another for loop which turn on and off the pins 
* Wire pins to LED anodes and connect a 220 resistor to ground.
* Upload code to Arduino IDE
